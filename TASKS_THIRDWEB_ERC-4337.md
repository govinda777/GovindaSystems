# Tasks for Thirdweb Setup

- [ ] **Install SDK:** Determine the correct SDK for the project stack (React, Node.js, etc.) and install it using the appropriate package manager (npm/yarn).
- [ ] **Generate API Keys:** Access the Thirdweb dashboard for the project `4a3420b4899e0d3f984aafbf8d088f4a` under the `govinda-systems-team` and generate necessary API keys if required for backend or specific SDK initializations.
- [ ] **Initialize SDK:** Import and initialize the Thirdweb SDK within the project codebase, using API keys if generated.
- [ ] **Implement Wallet Connection (Frontend):** If applicable, integrate Thirdweb's components or hooks to allow users to connect their crypto wallets.
- [ ] **Interact with Contracts:** Implement logic using the SDK to interact with deployed smart contracts (fetching data, sending transactions, minting tokens/NFTs, etc.).
- [ ] **Deploy New Contracts (Optional):** If necessary, use the Thirdweb dashboard or CLI/SDK to deploy any additional required smart contracts for the application.
- [ ] **Define Specific Goals:** Clarify the primary use case for Thirdweb in this project (e.g., NFT marketplace, ERC20 token launch, wallet authentication) to refine further tasks.
